When did you start and finish using this product? (provide the date and approximate time)

Start: 2/17, 11:30am, end 2/17, 8pm

How many tasks did you hope to complete? How many tasks did you actually complete?

I didn't start out with a set number of tasks for the day.  I added them as they arose.  All in all I listed 14 tasks, but only finished 8 of them.

How does this compare to your productivity on other days (do you feel like you accomplished more, less or the same as usual)?
Probably about the same as usual.  However, I did feel motivated to complete more to gain affection points and to hear the cat meow!  I loved playing with her and making her move across the screen. 

On a scale of 1-10, how engaged did you find yourself in organizing your tasks through taskDrop?

On a scale of 1-10, how enjoyable did you find the gamified interface?
9

What kind of emotions did the gamified aspect of the applications invoke, if any?

Joy, playfulness, motivation, satisfaction.

Did you have a favorite feature? Least favorite?

I loved how the cat jumped when i hovered! I didn't like how the done/x buttons were not all aligned to the right. 

Are there any improvements you would like to make to this application?

I wish the cat could move both ways instead of just one way.

When did you start and finish using this product? (provide the date and approximate time)
I started using the product around roughly noon on Friday, February 17th. I finished using the product at 1:00 today, Sunday, February 19th. I only actively used the product for Friday, though, and just had it running in the background Saturday because I still had a task left that I was unsure if I was still going to complete.

How many tasks did you hope to complete? How many tasks did you actually complete?
I hoped to complete three tasks and ended up completing two.

How does this compare to your productivity on other days (do you feel like you accomplished more, less or the same as usual)?
I would say I felt a bit more productive than usual because I was more cognizant of the tasks I had to complete. Knowing I would increase some tangible point total made me more motivated to complete my tasks than when I write them down normally. 

On a scale of 1-10, how engaged did you find yourself in organizing your tasks through taskDrop?
I would say 9 because it made me think about everything that I needed to do so I could write it down. Creating the to-do list is satisfying, but I docked a point because there was no feature to change the task order once they've been added. This would be helpful for organizing priority tasks.

On a scale of 1-10, how enjoyable did you find the gamified interface?
6 because receiving points for checking items off of the to-do list was very satisfying. However, I wish that there was more to do with the cat or that its behavior was more natural, such as walking around on its own at the bottom of the screen instead of only when the user clicks on it. I also was confused by the affection aspect, since it was blank regardless of tasks completed.

What kind of emotions did the gamified aspect of the applications invoke, if any?
The gamified aspect invoked feelings of satisfaction.

Did you have a favorite feature? Least favorite?
I think my favorite feature is honestly the sound effect for completing a task. It's a very nice sound! My least favorite would probably be the cat respawning at the left side of the screen after walking all the way to the right. It was a little jarring.

Are there any improvements you would like to make to this application?
I would definitely add the ability to organize tasks in the to-do list as well as make improvements to the cat, such as more activities, walking back and forth across the screen, etc. I also feel like there could be a returning user option upon opening the app so that users do not have to read the introduction every time. A shorter exit message might be better as well. Really great work on this, though!! I know it took a lot of time and effort and I think it really paid off. <3

I started today at 12:00 and finished tonight at 6:00. I completed four tasks. I have not been productive lately, so this definitely inspired me to be a little more productive. Still, I do not recognize a large increase in productivity after using the product. I would give a ranking of 7 for engagement through Task Drop. It was nice that it recommended I list a few things to do. It was easy to interact with the interface. I give a ranking of 6 for enjoyment. I specifically loved when the cat meowed. It was very cute and made me feel very happy. I think it would have been great to have affection points increase the ways you can interact with the cat. Earning new movements or methods of play can allow for the tasks to feel more rewarding. Let me know if you need more information.
