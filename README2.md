# Replication Instructions

Dependencies required to replicate and run the project:
* A code editor (ex: Visual Studio Code)
* Node.js v16.13.0 or above
* React.js v18.2.0 or above
* Phaser 3
* React-Spring
* Git
* A Github account

# 1. Clone the Project from Github
# 2. Configure the Cloned App
You can either open up the project in a code editor and use the terminal from there or the the terminal from your desktop. Open up either terminal and change the directory to the cloned project folder by running `cd projectfoldername`. Next, run `npm install` to get the `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` folder.
# 3. Run the Application
Run `npm start` in the terminal and it will show up on your local host on your default browser.
